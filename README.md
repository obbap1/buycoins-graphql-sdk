## Installation

```sh
npm i buycoins-graphql-sdk
```

### Authentication 

To access the Buycoins API, you will need to generate to generate a public and a secret key on thr `API Settings` screen in the Buycoins app. Enable this feature by sending a request to <support@buycoins.africa>.

From the Buycoins API documentation:

> The API is currently open to access requests from *fully verified* BuyCoins users. To apply, please send an email to support@buycoins.africa from your email account registered on BuyCoins.

## Quick Start

To create a naira deposit account:

```js
import { Buycoins } from 'buycoins-graphql-sdk'

// Pass in the public and secret key when creating a new instance.
// The base URL defaults to the sandbox / development URL. if you want to use this in production, the environment should be "production".
var buycoinsClient = new Buycoins(process.env.PUBLIC_KEY, process.env.SECRET_KEY, process.env.NODE_ENV)

// The SDK is promise based :). You can also use async/await
buycoinsClient.nairaAccount.createDepositAccount({
    accountName: "somtochi test"
})
.then(data => {
    // TODO: Handle data
})
.catch(err => {
   // TODO: Handle error
})
```

That's it!

## Usage

The SDK models the API and each property in the `Buycoins` class from the SDK matches with a section in the Buycoins API documentation.

### Naira Token Account

#### Create Virtual Deposit Account
To create a virtual bank account:

```
buycoins.nairaAccount.createDepositAccount({
    accountName: <replace-with-account-name>
})
```

### Placing Orders

#### Get Prices
To get active prices with the API:

```js
buycoins.orders.getPrices()

buycoins.orders.buy({
    amount: 0.01,
    price: "QnV5Y29pbnNQcmljZS04Y2ZhYjhmNS0yYTEwLTQ1NzUtOWRhNi1jNzQ4MWY5MDIyODk=",

BuyCoins API docs: [https://developers.buycoins.africa/placing-orders/sell](https://developers.buycoins.africa/placing-orders/sell)

#### Get Order

The buy and sell API usually returns an order object, To get the order, so that you can check the status:

buycoins.orders.getOrder(<order-id>)
```

Too lazy to loop over `getPrice` and get the correct ID for the crypto? We got you!

When buying:
```js
buycoins.orders.getPriceID(0.01,"ethereum", "Buy") 
```

When selling:
```js
buycoins.orders.getPriceID(0.01,"ethereum", "Sell") 
```

### P2P Trading

BuyCoins API docs: [https://developers.buycoins.africa/p2p/introduction](https://developers.buycoins.africa/p2p/introduction)

#### Dynamic Price Expiry

You can find out when next dynamic prices will be updated

```js
buycoins.p2p.getOrdersExpiry({
  status: "open"
})
```
BuyCoins API docs: [https://developers.buycoins.africa/p2p/post-limit-order#dynamic-price-expiry](https://developers.buycoins.africa/p2p/post-limit-order#dynamic-price-expiry)

#### Placing a limit order

You can place a static limit order using the `placeLimitOrder` method. `StaticPrice` is required:

```js
buycoins.p2p.placeLimitOrder({
    orderSide: "buy",
    amount: 0.01, 
    crypto: "bitcoin", 
    priceType: "static",
    staticPrice: 6000000,
  }
)
```

You can place a dynamic limit order using the `placeLimitOrder` method. `dynamicExchangeRate` is required:

```js
buycoins.p2p.placeLimitOrder({
    orderSide: "buy",
    amount: 0.01, 
    crypto: "bitcoin", 
    priceType: "dynamic",
    dynamicExchangeRate: 1.5,
  }
)
```

BuyCoins API docs: [https://developers.buycoins.africa/p2p/placing-a-limit-order](https://developers.buycoins.africa/p2p/placing-a-limit-order)

#### Placing a limit order

To post a market order call the `postMarketOrder` method.

Note from API documentation:
> When you want to sell cryptocurrency, orderSide should be buy so that your order is matched with a buy limit order. To buy cryptocurrency, orderSide should be sell

```js
buycoins.p2p.postMarketOrder({
    orderSide: "buy", // change to `sell` if you are buying crypto
    amount: 0.01, 
    crypto: "bitcoin", 
  }
)
```

### Run your own GraphQL queries

If we are yet to implement some features or you want to run some customized queries outside what the API provides. You can access the `query` function.

```js
buycoins.api.request(`query{
  getPrices{
    id
    cryptocurrency
    buyPricePerCoin
    minBuy
    maxBuy
    expiresAt
  }
}`)
```

You can pass in options to the query:

```js
const options = {
  name: "wanda"
}

buycoins.api.request(`mutation($name: String!) {
  createDepositAccount(accountName: name) {
    accountNumber
    accountName
    accountType
    bankName
    accountReference
  }
}`, options)
```

### Feature Parity with the Buycoins API

This project is in continous development and is striving for feature parity with the Buycoins API.The sections of the Buycoins API yet to be implemented are listed below:
